<h1>A4: Movie Updated [100 pts]</h1>
<h3>Due: Fri July 10 by 11:59pm</h3>
<h3>Summary:</h3>
<ol class="summary">
<li><strong>Solve some CodingBat problems.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Add additional functionality to the Movie class from A2.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2>[20 pts] Part 1: CodingBat</h2>
<ol>
<li>Go to&nbsp;<a href="http://codingbat.com/java" target="_blank">CodingBat.com/Java</a> and to the&nbsp;<a href="http://codingbat.com/java/Warmup-1" target="_blank">Warmup-1</a> set of problems. It looks like this:<br /> <img src="../../images/codingBat-warmup.png" alt="CodingBat Warmup-1 screenshot" title="CodingBat Warmup-1 screenshot" /></li>
<li>Complete any <strong>5</strong> of the problems in Warmup-1 (4 pts each). Some of the problems may involve constructs we haven't encountered yet, but solutions are available. Be sure to try the problem on your own before looking at the solution!</li>
<ul>
<li>When you complete a problem, the check mark turns green.</li>
<li>I recommend you create a free account so you can save your progress.</li>
</ul>
<li>Take a screen shot like the one above showing at least 5 green check marks and save it as <strong>LastName-a4-cb.png</strong> (or any common format such as pdf, jpg, etc.) using your last name.</li>
</ol>
<h2>[80 pts] Part 2: Make Improvements to the Movie Class</h2>
<ol>
<li>Download the movie project jar file from&nbsp;<a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=121213&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=PCCD-1564382" target="_blank">Content-&gt;Week 4-&gt;LastName-a4-movie.jar</a>. (This link will not work for you until you have received feedback on A2. Email the instructor if you think you should be able to access it but can't.) Rename the file substituting your last name, e.g., <i>Smith-a4-movie.jar</i>. Open the project in BlueJ.</li>
<li>As usual, update the header comment block and document your changes as you work.</li>
<li>As usual, adhere to Java style guidelines as described in Appendix J.</li>
<li>Open the source code for the Movie class. The changes you need to make are marked with <strong>TODO</strong> comments and include the following:</li>
<ol>
<li>Update a statement in one of the constructors.</li>
<li>Answer a question in a comment. (No code for this one.)</li>
<li>Add validation to the <code>setStarRating</code> method.</li>
<li>Add validation to the <code>increaseStarRating</code> method.</li>
<li>Add validation to the <code>decreaseStarRating</code> method.</li>
<li>Update the way <code>printMovieInfo</code> prints star ratings.</li>
</ol>
<li>After you implement each TODO, delete the TODO comment. <strong><i>There should not be any TODOs in your submitted project</i></strong> (unless you didn't complete the project).</li>
<li>As usual, you should be testing as you go to make sure everything works!</li>
<li>When you have completed the assignment, create a jar file of your project.</li>
<ol>
<li>While the project is open in BlueJ, choose Project-&gt;Create Jar File...</li>
<li>Check the "Include source" check box <span style="color: #ff0000;">&larr; <i>Very important!</i></span></li>
<li>Name the file <strong>LastName-a4-movie</strong> using your last name</li>
</ol></ol>
<h2>Submission and Grading</h2>
<p>Upload your Movie project jar file <strong>LastName-a4-movie.jar</strong> and CodingBat screenshot <strong>LastName-a4-cb.png</strong> (2 files) to the <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=121213&amp;type=dropbox&amp;rcode=PCCD-1564380" target="_blank">dropbox for the assignment</a>. The rubric that will be used to grade the assignment is available at the dropbox. If your assignment is not fully functional, use the comments area of the dropbox to notify the instructor of which parts aren't working.</p>
